# TracknTrace
 Track building performance and Trace errors back to the source

```python.exe .\wrapper.py .\<file>.metadata -v```
```python categorizer/categorizer.py <file>```
From line #940 - #950 there is clean data which is suitable for analysis. Every code run also exports 8 files with clean data, suitable for further analysis:
 * ```<file>_afternoon.csv``` - afternoon from 12:00 to 17:00
 * ```<file>_daily.csv```     - daily data, for each 24h
 * ```<file>_evening.csv```   - evening data from 17:00 to 23:00
 * ```<file>_hour.csv```      - hourly data, each hour
 * ```<file>_monthly.csv```   - monthly data, for each 30 days
 * ```<file>_morning.csv```   - morning data, from 7:00 to 12:00
 * ```<file>_night.csv```     - nightly data, from 23:00 to 7:00
 * ```<file>_weekly.csv```    - weekly data, for every 7 days

## Install

pip install TracknTrace

## Performance Tracking
 * Multiple modules are defined to calculate performance of different aspects/components
    * A standardized way is provided utilized to build these Modules
    * Your own case specific modules can easily be implemented
    * The file analysis.py will be imported on runtime
      * All functions in analysis.py will be run against the input data
    * Input data availble under the name ```data```
    * Each custom function needs to return data, new columns, visualize boolean
      * data is updated on return, new columns are used to propagate information and for visualization.

## Error Tracing
There are many ways to lead back errors to the source data. One way that is provided:
 * For each dataset you indicate its correlation to 6 different error catagories
 * These corelations are automatically propagated into derived datasets
 * These correlations are combined with statistical outlier and fault detection

The aggregate of **all** correlations and outliers is a measure to link effect(s) to cause(s)

A typical metadata file looks like the delivered example, see below for possible options.


## Metadata
Every analysis starts with creating a file named ```<dataname>.metadata```. This file should at least contain the headers as discussed below. Or refer to the example ```Prototype_Amini.metadata``` which is supplied with the code.
